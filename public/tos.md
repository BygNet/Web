# Byg Platform Terms of Service
Last updated: whenever we felt like it

Welcome to **Byg Platform**. If you are reading this, congratulations-you possess free will and literacy. By using Byg, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, simply do not use Byg. Close the tab. Walk into the sunset. We respect that.

## 1. What Is Byg
Byg Platform ("Byg", "we", "us", "the vibe") is an open-source social network where people may:
- Post text
- Upload images
- Exist online with intention
- Have opinions (within reason)

Byg includes multiple services such as Byg Social, Byg Picture, Byg Profile, and other things we are either building or thinking about building at 3am.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be:
- A human (bots are tolerated only if they behave)
- Old enough to use the internet in your country
- Emotionally prepared to see other people's takes

By using Byg, you confirm that you meet these requirements or are lying convincingly.

## 3. Your Account
You are responsible for:
- Your account
- Your posts
- The consequences of posting cringe

We are not responsible if you:
- Post something and regret it
- Start discourse
- Become famous accidentally

## 4. Content You Post
You own your content. Period.

By posting on Byg, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to display your content so that the platform can, you know, function.

Do not post:
- Illegal content
- Malware
- Hate speech
- Harassment
- Stuff that makes us sigh deeply

Posting something "as a joke" does not exempt it from consequences.

## 5. Moderation
Byg reserves the right to:
- Remove content
- Suspend or ban accounts
- Look disappointed but professional

Moderation decisions are made in good faith, guided by common sense, vibes, and community safety.

## 6. Open Source Reality Check
Byg is open source under the Apache License 2.0.

This means:
- You can inspect the code
- You can fork it
- You cannot sue us because you misunderstood how software works

## 7. Services That Are "Soon"
Some services are marked as "soon" or "alpha".

This means:
- They may be broken
- They may change
- They may disappear briefly and come back better

You agree not to emotionally attach to unfinished features.

---

## 8. Byg Pro
Byg Pro is an optional paid or enhanced experience (details TBD).

Buying Pro does not:
- Make you morally superior
- Grant immunity from moderation
- Turn you into a god

## 9. Termination
You may stop using Byg at any time.

We may stop providing Byg to you if you:
- Violate these Terms
- Act maliciously
- Become a net negative to the ecosystem

No hard feelings (ok maybe a little).

## 10. Disclaimer
Byg is provided "as is".

We do not guarantee:
- Uptime
- Virality
- That people will agree with you

Use at your own risk, curiosity, and emotional resilience.

## 11. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms occasionally.

If we do:
- We'll update the date
- The new Terms apply when posted
- Continuing to use Byg means you agree again (romantic, honestly)

## 12. Final Notes
- We love ash.
- BYGger = BETter.
- This is not a gambling site.
- Touch grass sometimes.

Thank you for using Byg.
Be kind. Be interesting. Be normal (optional).
